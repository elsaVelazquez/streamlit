summary: Reef-safe sunscreen chemical compositions to avoid oxybenzone for protection of coral reefs ***

This article https://www.applechem.com/blog/post/what-are-reef-safe-sunscreens-and-why-are-they-important describes reef-safe sunscreens.
Reef-safe sunscreens are those that are considered to be non-damaging to coral reefs. They typically do not contain oxybenzone and octinoxate, two chemicals found to cause coral bleaching. Instead, they use mineral UV filters like non-nano zinc oxide. However, the term 'reef-safe' isn't legally defined, and there's no absolute consensus on the safety of alternative ingredients. Ongoing research suggests more comprehensive environmental risk assessments are needed to confirm the impact of these alternatives on marine ecosystems. Consumers are encouraged to choose products without oxybenzone and octinoxate while staying informed about the latest research​​.


In this article https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/ we find alternatives that are reef-safe.
To avoid oxybenzone and octinoxate in sunscreens, which may be harmful to coral reefs, safer alternatives like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are recommended. These mineral-based ingredients are considered reef-safe and offer effective sun protection without the associated risks of hormone disruption and skin allergies often linked to chemical UV filters. It's essential to choose products that use these mineral UV filters to minimize environmental impact, especially when visiting sensitive marine ecosystems​​.
